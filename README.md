annual portfolio redesign

Every year I am a lil bit smarter and I use those smarts to make a new portfolio site. I have a large and somewhat eccentric body of work now, and this year I'm focusing on:
- sorting projects on two sets of vectors: type of work (graphics, games, comics) and category of client (journalism, corporate, personal)
- giving visuals more page weight
- dynamically generating pages using javascript
- increasing discoverability by suggesting similar projects
- possibly tracking which projects the user has already viewed in this session?

Some more conceptual goals include:
- emphasize that I design solutions, not just games, comics, or graphics
